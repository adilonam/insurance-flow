# Next.js Admin Dashboard - Cursor Rules

This project uses:

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Shadcn UI
- React Hook Form
- Zustand
- TanStack Table
- Zod
- Next auth

Follow colocation architecture: each feature keeps its pages, components, and logic inside its route folder. Shared UI, hooks, and config live at the top level. Maintain modern, minimal, and flexible design patterns.
